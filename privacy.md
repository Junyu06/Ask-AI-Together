# Privacy Policy for Side-by-Side AI

Last updated: 2026-02-23

## Overview

Side-by-Side AI is a Chrome extension that helps users open multiple AI chat websites side by side and send prompts to selected sites.

We are committed to minimizing data use and giving users control over permissions.

## Data We Process

The extension may process the following data locally in the browser:

- User settings (theme, language, layout, selected sites)
- Custom site configuration added by the user
- Local prompt history created by the user
- Current URL state for selected sites (for session continuity)

## How Data Is Stored

- Data is stored locally using Chrome extension storage (`chrome.storage.local`).
- We do not require account signup for core extension features.

## Host Permissions and Website Access

- The extension uses host permissions to interact with supported AI websites so it can automate input/send actions requested by the user.
- Built-in supported websites are declared in the extension manifest.
- For user-added custom websites, host access is requested at runtime and only granted if the user explicitly approves it.

## Data Sharing

- We do not sell user data.
- We do not transfer user data to third parties for advertising or unrelated profiling.
- We do not use user data to determine creditworthiness or for lending purposes.

## Remote Code

- The extension does not use remote executable code (no remote JS/Wasm execution as extension logic).

## Third-Party Websites

When users open or interact with third-party AI websites, those websites operate under their own privacy policies and terms. We are not responsible for third-party site practices.

## Security

We apply reasonable efforts to keep the extension minimal and permission-scoped. However, no software system can guarantee absolute security.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this policy from time to time. The "Last updated" date above will be revised when changes are made.
